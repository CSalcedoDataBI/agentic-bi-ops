# Changelog

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-26
### Changed
- `abios-feedback` hardened with explicit anti-confusion rules: capture is a sanitized issue on the
  CONSTANT target `CSalcedoDataBI/agentic-bi-ops` (never `gh repo view` of the cwd), personal account
  always, no writes to the current project; implementing happens in `$ABIOS_HOME`, not the cwd.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-26
### Added
- Coherent `board init`: now also sets the project's short description and README and links the repo
  (`gh project edit --description/--readme`, `gh project link`). Documents that the Default-repository
  pick and View name/layout are UI-only (no gh/GraphQL mutation).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-26
### Fixed
- Packaging: the plugin now lives in `plugins/agentic-bi-ops/` with its own `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
  and the marketplace points to it (`source: ./plugins/agentic-bi-ops`). The previous root-as-plugin
  layout (`source: ./`) was silently rejected by `/plugin marketplace add`. Guard/dev-infra stays at root.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-26
### Added
- `abios-feedback` skill — capture tool improvements discovered in any project in a sanitized,
  public-only form (the dogfooding feedback flow).
- Private-content guard: `scripts/guard-no-private.ps1` + `hooks/{pre-commit,pre-push}` +
  `scripts/install-guard.ps1` — blocks any commit/push containing secrets or terms from the
  local-only `.abios/private-denylist.txt`.
- `inbox/IMPROVEMENTS.md` for sanitized improvement notes.
### Changed
- Internal dev docs (`docs/`) are no longer tracked in the public repo (kept local).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-26
### Added
- `gh-account` foundation skill (cross-account token resolution, default CSalcedoDataBI).
- `projects-admin` skill + references (board-ops, issue-ops, automation).
- `/board` command.
- Plugin manifest + marketplace entry.
